Bash for Data Engineering
Why Bash for Data Engineering?
Bash is a powerful shell scripting language used for automating tasks in the Unix/Linux environment. In data engineering, Bash is often used for automating workflows, managing files, processing data, and integrating with databases and APIs.

Key Benefits:
Simplicity & Speed: Bash scripts are efficient for automating system tasks and file operations.
Versatile Integration: Easily integrates with other tools and languages, often used in data pipelines.
Text Processing: Bash is well-suited for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation in the form of log files, CSVs.
