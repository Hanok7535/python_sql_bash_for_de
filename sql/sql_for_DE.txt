SQL for Data Engineering
Why SQL for Data Engineering?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a fundamental tool for data engineers. It is used for querying and manipulating relational databases, which are at the heart of most data-driven systems. Understanding SQL is crucial for tasks like data retrieval, data transformation, and integration with other tools in the data pipeline.

Key Benefits of SQL for Data Engineering:
Data Retrieval: SQL is the standard language for querying data stored in relational databases.
Data Manipulation: SQL allows for filtering, sorting, and aggregating data to derive meaningful insights.
Scalability: SQL can handle large datasets and complex queries with efficiency.
Integration: SQL is widely used across the data ecosystem, making it a critical skill for interacting with various data systems and tools.
