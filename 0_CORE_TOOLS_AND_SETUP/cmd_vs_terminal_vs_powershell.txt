CMD vs Terminal vs PowerShell

1. CMD (Command Prompt)

What It Is:
A legacy Windows command-line interpreter. It executes .bat (batch) files and basic Windows shell commands.

How to Open:
Press Windows + R, type cmd, hit Enter Or search “Command Prompt” in Start.



Typical Usage:

Navigating Windows folders 
Running basic commands (dir, cd, echo)
Executing .bat scripts
Running Python and Git commands (though limited)


Limitations:
Old interface and functionality
Doesn’t support modern scripting or Linux-style commands
No support for piping objects (only text)


Example Commands:
cd Documents\project
dir
python script.py
git status

When to Use:
Very basic command-line usage
When you're doing simple folder navigation or file manipulation on Windows



2. PowerShell

What It Is:
A modern and powerful shell developed by Microsoft.
It supports full scripting, object-oriented command output, and advanced automation.

How to Open:
Search “PowerShell” in Start Or use Windows Terminal and open a PowerShell tab


Strengths:

Supports .ps1 scripts
Allows you to pipe entire objects (not just text)
Can run CMD commands and integrate with Windows API
Ideal for automation of Windows systems and DevOps tasks


Example Commands:
Get-ChildItem
Set-Location C:\Users\YourName
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 100}

When to Use:
When automating Windows tasks (e.g., scheduled backups)
When you need scripting beyond what CMD offers
For interacting with Windows services, registries, or applications



3. Terminal (General Concept)

What It Is:
A terminal is just the interface/window that runs shells like CMD, PowerShell, Git Bash, etc.
Think of it like a "container" or "shell runner".

On Windows:
Windows Terminal is the modern terminal app.
You can run CMD, PowerShell, Git Bash, or Ubuntu WSL inside it.


Why Important:
Makes it easy to work with multiple tabs (Git Bash + PowerShell + CMD together)
More customization (fonts, colors, keybindings)
Unified interface for all shells


Example Setup:

Tab 1: Git Bash for scripting
Tab 2: PowerShell for admin tasks
Tab 3: CMD for Python file testing



4. Git Bash

Just to Revisit Briefly:
A Linux-style Bash shell for Windows
Used for scripting and Git commands
Comes bundled with Git installation
Very helpful for practicing shell scripting for data workflows



5. Summary Table: When to Use What

Task					CMD	PowerShell	Git Bash

Basic Windows navigation		Yes	Yes		Yes
Run Python scripts			Yes	Yes		Yes
Git commands				Yes	Yes		Best
Bash scripting				No	No		Yes
Linux-like commands			No	Limited		Yes
Automation / scripting			Basic	Powerful	Yes (Linux-style)
File system admin			Okay	Excellent	Okay
Real-world DE usage			Rare	Rare		Preferred



6. Personal Recommendation (for Data Engineering)

Use Git Bash for:
Bash scripting, Git operations, Practicing Linux-style navigation


Use PowerShell for:
Windows admin tasks, Automating Windows-based setups


Use CMD only if:
You need quick, simple commands Or troubleshooting something old


Use Windows Terminal as your hub: Open Git Bash, PowerShell, and CMD all in one interface
