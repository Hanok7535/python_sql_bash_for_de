Python for Data Engineering
Why Python for Data Engineering?
Python is a versatile and powerful programming language commonly used in data engineering for its simplicity, wide range of libraries, and compatibility with various tools and platforms. In data engineering, Python helps automate workflows, manage data pipelines, process large datasets, and work with databases.

Libraries and frameworks: It has a rich ecosystem of libraries tailored for data engineering (e.g., pandas, numpy, pySpark).
Automation & Data Pipelines: Python helps in automating repetitive tasks and creating data pipelines that collect, clean, transform, and load data into databases.

What will we cover in Python for Data Engineering?
The goal is to cover key concepts, libraries, and tools that are essential for data engineering tasks. 
Core Topics to Cover:
1. Basic Python Syntax & Data Types: Variables, strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
2. Control Flow: Conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while), and error handling (try-except).
3. Functions & Modules: Writing functions, using libraries, and creating modules.
4. File Handling: Reading and writing files (e.g., CSV, JSON, text).
5. Data Processing Libraries:
	Pandas: Data manipulation, filtering, groupby, handling missing data.
	Numpy: Numerical computing, array manipulation.
	PySpark: Distributed data processing (optional, depending on scale of data).
6. Database Interaction:
	Using Python libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy, pyodbc) to connect with SQL databases and perform operations.
7. APIs: Interacting with APIs (RESTful APIs) to extract data and integrate with other systems.
8. Data Pipeline Frameworks: Basics of Airflow, Luigi, and Prefect (optional).
9. Testing and Debugging: Unit testing (e.g., pytest), debugging techniques.
